<!--Title:Query for Raw JSON-->
<!--Url:query_json-->

This is [also forthcoming work](https://github.com/JasperFx/Marten/issues/16). The point is to be able to fetch the raw JSON from the database for a document and immediately stream that data to a web client without having to take the performance hit of deserializing and serializing the object to and from JSON.
