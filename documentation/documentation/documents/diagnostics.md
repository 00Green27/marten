So far, Marten has no more than rudimentary diagnostics, but we hope to have much more in the future.

## Accessing Diagnostics

All the diagnostics are going to be exposed off of the `IDocumentStore.Diagnostics` property. Today, the only capabilities are to get a preview of the generated storage code or a preview of the ADO.Net code that will be generated for a Linq query.

## Previewing Linq Queries

Let's say that we have a small document type called `Trade`:

<[sample:trade_document_type]>

The `[Searchable]` attribute directs Marten to duplicate the value of `Value` into a separate database field for more efficient querying. Now, let's say that we want to search for every `Trade` document with a value of over 2,000, but we want to see the SQL query that Marten will build for that query first:

<[sample:preview_linq_command]>

The sql string in our debug window for the code above is:

<pre>
select d.data from mt_doc_trade as d where d.value > :arg0
</pre>


## Previewing Storage Code

To unwind a problem in Marten usage or just to understand how Marten is acting to persist a document type, you can also preview the storage code that Marten would generate for a document type behind the scenes. The usage of that preview for the same `Trade` document type used above is shown in the sample below:

<[sample:preview_storage_code]>

Finally, the output of the sample above is the code for the `TradeStorage` class that is typically code generated by Marten:

<[sample:generated_trade_storage]>
