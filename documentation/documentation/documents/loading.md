<!--Title:Loading Documents by Id-->
<!--Url:loading-->

Documents can be loaded by id from the `IDocumentSession` interface, either one at a time or by an enumerable of id values. The load by id functionality
again supports Guid's, integers, long integers, and strings.

The syntax is shown below:

<[sample:load_by_id]>
