<!--Title:Marten as Event Store-->
<!--Url:events-->

Marten's EventStore capability is forthcoming, as the document db feature is more important to my employer at the moment;-)

The general idea is to take an earlier [Event Store implementation on Postgresql](http://jeremydmiller.com/2014/10/22/building-an-eventstore-with-user-defined-projections-on-top-of-postgresql-and-node-js/) and adapt the ideas for a .Net client.
